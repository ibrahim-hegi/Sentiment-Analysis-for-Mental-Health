# Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health



## Project Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on mental health-related data using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The primary goal is to classify text data into different sentiment categories, providing insights into mental health trends.

## Dataset
- **Source:** The dataset used in this project is loaded from a CSV file.
- **Structure:** The dataset contains text data that is analyzed for sentiment.

## Steps and Workflow

1. **Importing Libraries:**
   - The notebook begins by importing essential Python libraries, including:
     - `pandas` for data manipulation.
     - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
     - `nltk` for natural language processing.
     - `keras` and `tensorflow` for building and training deep learning models.
     - `sklearn` for various machine learning utilities.

2. **Reading the Dataset:**
   - The dataset is read into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Tokenization:** Splitting text into words using `word_tokenize`.
   - **Lemmatization:** Converting words to their base forms using `WordNetLemmatizer`.
   - **Stopwords Removal:** Removing common words that do not contribute to sentiment (e.g., "and", "the").
   - **Text Cleaning:** Removing punctuation, numbers, and special characters to prepare the text for analysis.
   - **Vectorization:** Converting text data into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization.

4. **Handling Imbalanced Data:**
   - Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are employed to address class imbalances in the dataset.

5. **Model Building:**
   - **Sequential Model:** A deep learning model is built using the Keras library, with layers including Embedding, LSTM, and Dense.
   - **Training and Validation:** The model is trained on the processed dataset, with evaluation metrics such as loss and accuracy being tracked.

6. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualizations are generated to understand the distribution of sentiments in the data, the frequency of different words, and other relevant insights.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure that all necessary libraries are installed. You can install them using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk imbalanced-learn tensorflow keras wordcloud scikit-learn
     ```

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially. Start from data loading, proceed through preprocessing, and finally, build and train the model.

3. **Expected Output:**
   - The notebook will output visualizations of the data, along with the performance metrics of the trained model.

## Results and Observations
The notebook demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be effectively applied to mental health data, providing insights that could be valuable for research or interventions in mental health.
